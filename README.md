# TV Shows API - Code Challenge

This project was build using an **“Angular and ASP.NET Core 8”** project on Visual Studio 2022, 
and additional the **Entity Framework** was used to map the high-level data access layer with .NET (C#).

**Swagger** was used to debug the endpoints and generate the documentation.

When the server is running, you can check the Swagger UI on **https://localhost:<port>/swagger/index.html**, 
where <port> is a randomly chosen port number set at the project creation (in a localhost case was 7281).

For the frontend, the only external dependence used was Bootstrap.

You can use **https://127.0.0.1:4200/** for viewing the web page.
